              A junior member of the Bracer Guild in the city of Rolent, and the main protagonist of the game. Her cheerful and energetic personality usually contrasts her initial reckless and naive side, getting riled up easily in tense moments. Despite this, she is one of the kindest characters in the game, and her benevolence can arguably only be matched by her skill in the bo staff.

              <p>"The Silver Streak"</p><hr>
              An A-rank senior bracer in the Rolent branch, and Estelle and Joshua's acting mentor. Her duality in being easygoing and strict to a fault has earned her an older sister-like relationship with Estelle through the years and the admiration of those close to her. She is no stranger to fun and games, and her overall perseverance and skill with the whip is only rivaled by her terrifying tolerance for alcohol.

              <p>"The Debaucherous Hunter of Love"</p><hr>
              An eccentric, wandering bard from the Erebonian empire. He has a dramatic personality and a flair for the arts, never skipping an opportunity to be the spotlight of any situation. He loves fine wine almost as much as he loves playing the lute, and his passion for passion, in general, makes every adventure with him anything but ordinary. Despite his aloof personality, he actually boasts a hidden serious side, as well as an unusual level of marksmanship with orbal guns.

              The jerk with a golden heart, a senior rank bracer, and an ex-member of the Ruan region's infamous Raven Gang. His caring and selfless side is heavily cloaked by his crass and tough demeanor towards people, which usually isn't taken too well by people he meets due to his directness. Circumstances past has caused him to be the hardest on no one but himself. His trademark crimson hair and heavy claymore pays homage to one of his many given aliases, "The Ever Burning Flame".

              <p>"The Girl Skilled in Orbal Engineering"</p><hr>
              An innocent and cheerful girl who works at the Zeiss region's Central Factory. Her faculty for technology exceeds that of even the most seasoned of sceintists thanks to her grandfather's mentorship. The cute and loving individual exudes a unique childlike wonder in front of the machines she fiddles with, eventually taking on a role as Estelle's hypothetical little sister. As she occasionally travels the city whenever work requires her to, she does so without much worry, probably thanks to the orbal cannon she always has strapped around her person.

              <p>"The Immovable Wall"</p><hr>
              A visiting senior bracer from Liberl's eastern neighboring country, The Calvard Republic. He has an honorable aura that is as intimidating as his huge stature. However, he is actually a pretty chappy fellow once he starts to introduce himself. Once a student of the Taito Style, he constantly trains his physical and spiritual self whenever he has the time, and has resulted in him being a master of martial arts. Whenever words aren't enough for Zane to settle differences, he only becomes much more of a challenge when he gets his fists involved.
