            First released for the PC in 2004 by Nihon Falcom in Japan,
            <b>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC</b> was the first
            release of the iconic Trails trilogy that would later became the
            prologue of what eventually became known as the
            <b>Legend of Heroes</b> series. Its first English version was
            released by the North American video game company
            <b>Xseed Games</b> 5 years after its port to the PlayStation
            Portable in 2006.

              The Trails series has been hailed as one of the longest, largest,
              and most intricate turn-based
              <abbr title="Japanese Role-Playing Games">JRPG</abbr> series in
              history, only further boosting its popularity with the English
              releases of its second chapter in 2015 and third chapter in 2017.
              <br /><br />

              It is currently available to play on PC on Steam, and has even
              been ported in high-definition on the PlayStation 3 and the
              PlayStation Portable. A remaster of the game was also introduced
              to the PS Vita back in 2015, but is only available in Japan.<br /><br />

              Its large cast of playable characters, creative world design, and
              unrivaled level of combat customization has quickly allowed it to
              become Nihon Falcom's most popular and best-selling franchise to
              date.

              The events of the game mostly revolve around the lives of two
              protagonists: Estelle Bright and her adopted brother, Joshua. They
              start their journey completing their training to become fully
              affiliated members of the bracer guild, a non-governmental
              organization that serves to maintain the peace and protect
              civillians in the continent through various means. One day, their
              father suddenly disappears aboard an airline that ends up going
              missing. The two then leave their hometown to embark on a journey
              around the kingdom of Liberl to investigate the incident while
              further progressing their ranks from junior to senior bracers.
              They create new friendships and experience new conflicts along the
              way as they face the different challenges awaiting them along the
              way, using the feelings of those around them to unfold a new
              generation.

            Fifty years prior to where the game first begins, in the vast
            continent of Zemuria, came the dawn of the
            <b>Orbal Revolution</b>, which skyrocketed the innovations in
            technology that humanity was capable of producing thanks to what is
            known as <b>orbal energy</b>. This energy originates from mystical
            objects known as <b>orbments</b>, an ancient artifact discovered by
            a scientist in the middle of resarching a long-gone civilization.
            This leads to a massive power shift in societies throughout the
            entire continent, upheaving the political balance that were
            dominated previously by monarchies and aristocracies as a new,
            innovative method of acquiring such magical power can now be
            obtained by any city that has adept enough scientists to do so.
            Thus, the advent of orbal technology makes it possible for normal
            citizens to go through their everyday lives with much ease; whether
            they are travelling to different cities, fending off the different
            monsters roaming the world, or creating public facilities to improve
            their own quality of life.<br /><br />

              With their small world suddenly entering their own version of the
              industrial evolution within the span of a human lifetime, Zemurian
              society enters an inevitable state of chaos. The rapid advancement
              in transportation completely transforms the nation's state of
              trade, turning simple merchants into economic juggernauts. The
              companies creating these orbments have become more relied upon by
              the masses than their own governments. Where only a mere few
              decades ago, upward social mobility seemed virtually impossible,
              is now essentially the norm; and this does not sit well with the
              people and organizations that have remained in power prior to this
              technological evolution. Non-democratic nations that are ruled by
              aristocrats and royalty become dwarfed by mega corporations
              economically. This is the underlying concept that drives the story
              forward as its protagonists go about their lives unaware of such
              problems brewing beneath the surface.
