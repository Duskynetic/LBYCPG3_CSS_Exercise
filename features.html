              It is almost common knowledge that the
              <abbr title="Original Soundtrack">OST</abbr> is a "make-or-break"
              aspect in any game. A good auditory experience is just as
              important at getting the player immersed in the world as the
              actual gameplay. Nihon Falcom knocks this out of the park with a
              wide range of soundtracks with different genres befitting the
              areas in which they are played.<br /><br />

              The game's
              <abbr title="EnDing song">ED</abbr> entitled
              <b><i>Hoshi no Arika</i> (星の在り処)</b>, which is translated to
              <b>The Whereabouts of Stars</b> in English, is a somber
              masterpiece that plays well with the visual of the game summing up
              the events that had happened prior as well as teasing what's to
              come for the sequel. Nihon Falcom specifically wrote the song for
              the game itself. Along with most songs in the soundtrack, it pays
              attention to the context with care and further deepens player
              immersion the further players get into the story.

              Trails in the Sky boasts a unique way of depicting its world with
              the use of somewhat three-dimensional game assets with
              two-dimensional character sprites not commonly used in games in
              the similar genre during its time. <br /><br />

              The game camera constantly maintains focus on the player and their
              party of characters for majority of the game. To adjust on which
              the game is displayed, an option is available for players to
              rotate the camera view 45 degrees at a time, providing a
              comprehensive view of each area that sells the perspective of an
              enthusiastic tourist looking around an unknown city more than it
              usually would have without this viewing feature.<br /><br />

              The lore surrounding the Trails series is jam-packed with
              storytelling and does an excellent job introducing the player to
              thier world without it feeling too forced. They manage to create a
              world mixed with fantasy, steampunk, and anime elements all caught
              up in a land slowly building up political and economic turmoil due
              to a rapidly growing technological age. <br /><br />

              While it can be said that a number of aspects in the story aren't
              all that original, especially at this day and age, their execution
              of these aspects provide a comprehensive and fulfilling experience
              that rivals most stories in fiction as whole even today.

              One of the most critically acclaimed things that Trails in the Sky
              has been known for is its unmatched quality of their game worlds
              in terms of the most important aspect that makes a game feel alive
              and realistic: its people. <br /><br />

              Trails managed to create a vast world wherein every character has
              their own names and personalities that aren't connected to the
              main character. Every major city upholds its own unique political
              and economic agendas. Dialogue for every
              <abbr title="Non-playable Character">NPC</abbr> changes as they
              live their lives parallel to the main character's own progression
              throughout the game. The developers made sure that no detail is
              ever trivialized and it has been nothing short of astounding.

              The turn-based combat of Trails isn't uncommon in the JRPG world.
              It has been used aplenty in even the most well-known RPGs of today
              like <b>Final Fantasy VII</b>,
              <b>South Park: The Stick of Truth</b>, and many more. <br /><br />

              What makes Trails stand out above the rest is its highly
              customizable magic system and character-unique skills that not
              only make your team stronger, but also sometimes directly
              influence the battle order, giving the player an edge at crucial
              moments for when it is needed. The complexity of combat also pays
              homage to the factor of random status effects that affect specific
              characters based on the turn order. It can be tedious to take in
              for a while but it pays off quickly due to how players can have
              not only flexible team compositions, but flexible roles for team
              members as well.
